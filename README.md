# Global-Bifurcation-Analysis-for-Siderophore

Project Title: Global Bifurcation Analysis for Siderophore

Author: Zhang Xiaoyi

Prerequisites:
MATLAB R2022a or higher is recommended.

Usage Instructions:

Step 1: Run tiezaiti.m
Execute this script first to generate the necessary simulation data.
The generated files will be saved automatically in the same folder as the script.
Step 2: Run analy_v6.m
After the first step is complete, execute this script.
It will read the files generated in the previous step and perform the bifurcation analysis.
Notes:

Please execute the scripts in the order listed above.
Do not move or renamed the intermediate files generated by tiezaiti.m, as analy_v6.m relies on them being in the same directory.
